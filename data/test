how do i take photos for e-commerce ? i need to take photos for my online store.  any ideas?  how do i create a transparent background? you need 2 lights to get contrast.  set one at 10 o'clock and one at 7 o'clock.  put a difuser (white paper) in front of the 7 o'clock lite (you want half the light from that one).  use a background with a single strong color (not the same as the product) that you can select in photoshop to delete out the background.  support the product on a rod (stick it on using putty) that is behind the product so it does not show.  keep the background as far away as possible and use as large an f stop as you can while keeping the whole product in focus.  that's about it!	6
what is the u.s. green card procedure after labor certificate approval and how much time it will take?   this depends mainly on which state you are . usually the more immigrants like texas, california , florida could take 7 to 15 months. other states with few cases could be shorter. if you've got the labor permit i believe you are more than halfway in the process, once you start the i485 ( not sure if the correct number) you are done , just a matter of wait. the more  important document you need in this stage is the travel document or travel parole that is only valid for one year and take slike two months to renew so you need to apply every 10 months. with thia paper you are free to move outside of the us and comeback. you do not need a visa anymore just wait until your residence card is ready.	9
